Notes: - BluuBomb requires Linux. It's easiest in an Ubuntu VM. - You will need a compatible Bluetooth adapter so keep that in mind (In my experience Realtek adapters do not work, although they should be supported.) What you need: BluuBomb Tiramisu SD Prep: Copy the contents of the Tiramisu zip to the root of the SD Card. Copy the root.rpx file from the wiiu folder to root of the SD Card, and rename to launch.rpx . Insert the SD Card into the Wii U. Setting up and using BluuBomb: Follow this to set up BluuBomb. Installing the PayloadLoader into Health and Safety: Navigate to installer and then press A to Check. Press A on Install / Update . You\u2019ll be asked if you are sure you want to install the PayloadLoader. Use the D-Pad to select Install and press A. Press A to shut down the console. NAND Backup: Load the the Health and Safety application while holding B. Navigate to nanddumper and press A. Make the settings look like this and then press A. MLC is optional as it is the biggest part of the NAND Backup (8gb or 32gb depending on your model). -SLC: Yes -SLCCMPT: Yes -MLC: Optional -OTP: Yes -SEEPROM: Yes Wait for it to finish. It may take a few hours if you opted to dump MLC. To make sure you don\u2019t lose the files, copy the slc.bin , slccmpt.bin , seeprom.bin , otp.bin and if you chose to go with a full backup, every mlc.bin.part file to your computer. Delete the files to free up space on the SD Card. Autobooting Tiramisu Start the console to boot into the Wii U Menu, launch the Health and Safety Information app and hold the X button to open the Environment Loader menu. Navigate the list using the D-Pad and navigate to the installer environment, press A to launch it. Press A to select Check . Select Boot Options . You will be asked if you want to switch the boot title. Press A to select Switch to PayloadLoader When the process finished, press A to shutdown the console. The PayloadLoader will now be launched automatically on every boot. Finalize: It is now a good idea to finalize your Tiramisu installation.

Don't worry if building the emulator itself fails due to missing SDL headers. Just continue with the next steps. Stop the already running bluetooth service sudo systemctl disable --now bluetooth . Run the custom built bluetoothd sudo ./bluez-4.101/dist/sbin/bluetoothd -d -n . Download the bluubomb binary and the sd_kernels.zip from the releases page. Copy a kernel binary of your choice from the sd_kernels.zip to the root of your SD Card and rename it to bluu_kern.bin . (If you're here from the tiramisu installation guide with bluubomb you will want loadrpx.bin ) Power on the Wii U, insert your SD Card and press the sync button. Make sure there are no other controllers connected. Open a new terminal and make the bluubomb file executable by running chmod +x bluubomb .
